1. Challenge: Create a Person class in Python that has a name, age, and gender
attribute. Add methods to the class for getting and setting(minus init method)
these attributes, as well as a method for printing out the person's information in
the format "Name: [name], Age: [age], Gender: [gender]".
2. Have an example of polymorphism and inheritance using above class to create a
voter object. The voter object should have a method that checks the age and
validates whether the person can be allowed to vote or not. Handle the errors
using a try and except method.
Example Usage:
person = Person()
person.set_name("Alice")
person.set_age(30)
person.set_gender("female")
person.print_info()
